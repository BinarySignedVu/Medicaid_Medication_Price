Medicaid_Medication_Price
Introduction
Medicaid_Medication_Price is a Python-based project designed to analyze and visualize medication price data from the Medicaid database. It offers insights into the cost of drugs over time, the distribution of medication prices, and other critical metrics that can inform healthcare policy and consumer decisions.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

MySQL Community Edition: This serves as the database where medication price data is stored and managed.
Visual Studio Code (VS Code): This is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for writing and executing the Python code.
Installation
Install MySQL Community Edition: Download and install it from MySQL's official website.
Install Visual Studio Code: Download VS Code from here. After installation, proceed to set up the necessary extensions:
Python Notebook Extension: This extension allows you to run Python code in a notebook-style interface within VS Code.
SQL Notebook: This is used for executing SQL queries directly from VS Code.
Setting Up the Project
Configure MySQL Credentials: After installing SQL Notebook, configure your MySQL credentials including the host, port, user, and database/schema details as per your MySQL setup.
Open the Notebook: Navigate to and open the Medicaid_Medication_Price.ipynb file in VS Code.
The notebook is divided into sections with markdown comments explaining each code block. Follow these comments for a guided experience in analyzing the medication price data.
Running the Program
Each cell in the notebook is executable. Run each cell sequentially to:

Connect to the MySQL database.
Fetch and process the medication price data.
Visualize the data using various statistical graphs.
Perform data cleaning, including outlier removal, to ensure accurate analysis.
